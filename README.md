Yii 2 YarCode Project Template 
=============================== 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yarcode/yii2-app-yarcode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yarcode/yii2-app-yarcode) 

Requirements 
------------
The minimum requirement by this project template that your Web server supports PHP 7+.

Installation 
------------
Install [composer](http://getcomposer.org]).

You can then install this project template using the following command:

``` 
composer create-project --prefer-dist yarcode/yii2-app-yarcode yarcode 
—Åd yarcode 
php init 
``` 

Change the settings in the `common/config/main-local.php` and apply migrations. Make sure that you are properly configured to connect to the database.
``` 
php yii migrate 
``` 

The template installation is now complete.

Quality Control 
---------------

### Testing
Tests are in the test catalogs `{application}/tests`.
They are developed with [Codeception PHP Testing Framework](http://codeception.com/). By default there are 2 test suites for each applications(`api`, `frontend`, `backend`): 

- unit 
- functional 

For more information about testing Yii2 applications, [read here](http://codeception.com/docs/modules/Yii2) 

You can run all the tests that are in the template
``` 
vendor\bin\codecept run 
``` 
It is possible to run only unit or only functional tests for the application, for example
``` 
vendor\bin\codecept run unit -c backend 
vendor\bin\codecept run functional -c api 
``` 
Also you can run some specific test by specifying the path to it
``` 
vendor\bin\codecept run functional -c api v1/ApiCest 
``` 
For debugging, it can be convenient to run tests with the flags `-f` and` --debug`
``` 
vendor\bin\codecept run functional -c api v1/ApiCest -f --debug 
``` 

### Travis CI 

To automatically build and test the application in a template, use [Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/). The configuration is located in the file `.travis.yml` in the project's root directory. 

In the configuration file added [PHP Coding Standards Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer). 

### PHP Coding Standards Fixer

This tool allows us to automatically check the project code for compliance with standards and rules.

The configuration is in the file `.php_cs` in the project's root directory.

Execute the command to verify the code for compliance with the [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) standard 
``` 
vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix -v --dry-run 
```
